        d--> A special charactor (@,#,$,%,^,* etc) cannot be used in the variable  naming
        d-->A variable name should be according to the purpose of that variable (it is a good programming practice) but it is not mandatory

Q4. Is it possible for us to declare “_” as a variable? If so, then write an example of it.
Ans 4 . Yes python allow us to use "_" in a variable anywhere
       --> _ = 6467646 --> it is also valid
       -->  _myVar = 34468
       -->  my_Var = "hey there"
       -->  myVar_ = 25.6
       -->  myV_var =35+4j

Q5. Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature.
Ans 5 .python  Variable's are dynamic in nature because in pyhton we do not have to define the data type of variable
          It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the 
          program

        myVar = 46963 --> in it we didn't define the datatype but python identify that what type of data stored in the same
